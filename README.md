### How to install and run

First clone the repo and navigate into the directory.

This project contains javascript, so you must start a local web server to see it function. The following options will expose your `src/` folder to http://localhost:8000/ via Python or NodeJS, respectively.

```
python -m http.server 8000 -d ./src
```

```
npx http-server ./src -p 8000
